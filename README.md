This is a java compiler for Mini Pascal code.

Scanner Functionality:

To use, import the scanner into your current project. Point the scanner at a mini pascal 
file. The nextToken() function will return each mini pascal token it finds.

Future Functionality:

As this project progresses, the user will be able to package this project as a jar file
and execute it on a pascal file. The result will be compiled into MIPS Assembly.
